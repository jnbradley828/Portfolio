### This is a data analysis project for my personal chess.com games, going back to 2020. I am still working on adding more visulations and insights.
### The png files are the final output of this project. If you'd like to see the code, open Chess Data Analysis.ipynb.
### In a future version, I'd like to make this an application, where you can type in your username and optional date range, and have a variety of analytics automatically generated for you.
